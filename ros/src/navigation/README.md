## The Navigation Stack

The self-driving vehicle uses a modified version of the ROS navigation stack. The flowchart above illustrate the mapping and path planning process. First, I create a detailed map of the environment with `rtabmap_ros`. With that global map, I use the localization feature of `rtabmap_ros` and the odom feature of the zed camera system to localize and plan paths.

### RTABMap

`rtabmap` (realtime appearance based mapping) allows me to construct a global map of the environment. For more information on the mapping package, please check out this [`.launch` file](./ros/src/navigation/mapping/launch/rtab_mapping.launch).

### Path Planning

The project uses the [`move_base`](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base) node from the navigation stack. The image below shows the costmap (in blue and purple), and the global occupancy grid (in black and gray). `move_base` also plans the local and global path. Global paths are shown in green and yellow below. You can find the `yaml` files [here](./ros/src/navigation/path_planning/params).

### Vehicle Motion Control

The move base node publishes `/cmd_vel` commands, which are processed and sent directly to the vehicle.
