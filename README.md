Welcome! This is an open source self-driving development platform aimed for rapid prototyping, deep learning, and robotics research. The system currently runs on a modified electric golf cart. Here are our goals:

### Goals:
Research and develop a deep learning-driven self-driving car. The vehicle should be able to achieve level 4 autonomy within a geofenced area.

#### The modules in this project.

1. End-to-End Steering (Behavioral cloning)
2. Semantic Segmentation
3. Object Detection ðŸš™
4. Drive by Wire (DBW)
5. CARLA simulator integration 
6. ZED stereoscopic vision system
7. Mapping with rtabamp
8. Path planning with ROS nav stack. 
9. Localization, pose tracking, and odom with ZED and rtabmap.

## Try it out
Before you jump in, let me describe the hardware requirement for this project. **A webcam is the minimum requirment.** At this point, you can only run the whole system on the actual self-driving vehicle. ROS will throw warnings (even errors) at you if you don't have the hardware connected to your Linux machine. **If you don't have access to the hardware setup, don't worry** ðŸ‘‡
 
- The best way is to download and play back the ROS bags. [coming soon...]
- You can tryout individual packages and nodes, and might find them helpful for your own projects. 
- You can also tryout the CARLA simulator. (Maybe even improve the current system.)

To compile the project:

##### Requirements

1. Make sure that you have [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu) installed on your computer. (I am using ROS Melodic)
2. Make sure you have all the [dependencies](./ros/requirements.txt) installed. 

##### Clone & Compile

1. Clone the repository. `$ git clone https://github.com/sigmaai/self-driving-golf-cart.git`
2. `$ cd self-driving-golf-cart/ros` 
3. `$ catkin_make`
4. `$ source devel/setup.bash`

##### Launch ZED cameras
- `$ roslaunch zed_wrapper zed.launch` (no rviz)
- `$ roslaunch zed_display display.launch` (with rviz)

##### Launch the Navigation Stack
- `$ roslaunch path_planning rtab_mapping_navigation.launch`
